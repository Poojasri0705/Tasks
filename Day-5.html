    <h2 style="color: brown;">The Magical Bottle</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a <span class="fp">faraway land,</span> there was a mysterious magical bottle. Legends spoke
        of its <u>enhancing powers</u> and the wonders it held within.</p>
    <p>People from all around the kingdom heard of the bottle's <s>mystical allure.</s>It was said that the bottle had
        the ability to <sub>shrink</sub> or <sup>enlarge</sup> anything placed inside it. Rumors even mentioned <span class="sp"><i>time-traveling</i></span> sand hidden within.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">Discovery of Bottle</h2>
    <p>As reached the heart of the forest, she stumbled upon a hidden <span style="color: red;">glistening cave.</span>
        Inside the cave, she discovered the long-lost <span style="color: green;">magical bottle</span> resting on a
        pedestal.</p>

    <p>Eager to uncover its secrets, Elena carefully examined the bottle. Its surface was adorned with intricate
        patterns, and a faint glow emanated from within. She couldn't resist the temptation to open it.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">The Wonders Unveiled</h2>
    <p>As the bottle's cap was lifted, a burst of <span style="color: yellow;">golden light</span> filled the cave. To
        her amazement, Elena found herself surrounded by <span style="color: red;">floating books</span> containing
        stories from different eras.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">The Journey Continues</h2>
    <p>Elena's adventure had just begun. Armed with the magical bottle, she set out on a <i>time-traveling quest</i>,
        exploring ancient civilizations, witnessing legendary events, and learning the stories of the past.</p>
